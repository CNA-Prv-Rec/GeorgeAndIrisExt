        <h3>About the crop swap</h3>

        This is a free service, set up due to the predicted world food shortage we are about to have. If you are growing fruit and veg this year and want to produce a bit extra that you wouldn't normally be able to pass on to others, this site is a great way to find others who might be able to swap, buy or sell fruit and vegetables to help everybody along during these difficult times. Normally we limit ourselves to what we can use, but there may be reasons this year to do a bit extra so long as we are able to find someone to use it.

        <br /><br />

        The site costs money to run so at some point will need to be funded. If you want to support it feel free to donate on our gofundme page (will set up soon!). Alternatively, the site will also be for sale  when it is finished for someone who might want to take it on officially.

    <br /><br />
    As you might expect there is a developer behind the site, which is currently <a href="https://www.designwithwisdom.com" target="_blank">Design with Wisdom Ltd</a>. I am a freelance web developer for hire if you want any development services, like maintaining the site for whoever might one day be the new owners.

      <p>It doesn't really matter who you are, you can still make a difference. To yourself, to your community, even to the world.</p>

      <p>With covid and all that came with it, the last few years might have been tough. But they have not beaten us. And with planning and hard work neither will the future. But it starts now.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have only a garden to grow crops in. When covid struck, I lost my job as a developer, along with millions of other workers around the globe. So I dredged out the gardening skills my grandfather taught me when I was very young, and I got growing. I bought 15 strawberry plants which the garden centre was getting rid of dirt cheap in a panic that they'd have no staff to care for them, some seed packets and a few bags of compost (also super-cheap due to covid panic). That was all it took to turn the garden into a livelihood over the coming months until the world (and my job) recovered. When you have skills, you can pretty much do anything you want. We just need to use them. And hopefully pass them down to the younger generation too. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Now it is 2022, and after two years of covid, it looks like my garden isn't going to be enough to save the world from the food shortages that look to be on the horizon. It looks like the world is going to need you guys to muck in and help too. With wars and food export bans, maybe the future seems powerless and uncertain. But it isn't, this is very far from the truth. We just need to get working. If we all even produce a small amount more than we need when we're on our allotments or in our gardens, and swap it with others, we will be making a difference. I don't have the right soil to grow carrots for instance, but they're my kids' staple food. They hate peas but I can grow peas so we're looking for swaps even now. Carrots for peas anybody? But you get my point - the future is in our hands. All we have to do is put the effort in.

      <p>As for me, now it's time to give back. I'm a developer, I can build anything I want on the web, this site if my gift to the world for this year. If I can enable you, then I've done my job well.</p>

      <p>By the way, if anybody needs a website let me know. I'm a freelancer so I'm for hire. And I'm also passing my skills down, so my kids will be joining me over the summer to do more programming during their A-levels.
